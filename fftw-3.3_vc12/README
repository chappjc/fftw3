The folder containing fftw-3.3.sln, called fftw-3.3_vc12 by default, must be in the FFTW root folder, alongside the api, dft, etc. folders.

Notable settings in config.h:

 * HAVE_AVX enabled
 * HAVE_ISNAN define since it's now in VS 2013
 * HAVE_OPENMP defined (testing this)
 * etc.

These projects are based on the VS 2010 projects from https://github.com/ZECTBynmo/SparkPlug/tree/master/FFTW/fftw-3.3-libs.

Work in progress!
